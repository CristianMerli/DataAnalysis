abstract="One of the really big growth areas for Python is in the sciences, where data analysis is a huge component. Happily, Python includes a Swiss Army tool for data analysis, namely the pandas package, which can be installed from the PyPi repository with pip. pandas provides a lot of the data handling and data processing tools that you may be accustomed to if you come from an R background. Several new data types are introduced, along with additional functionality to handle the actual data processing in a very efficient manner. It achieves this efficiency by building on the functionality provided by the numpy package.",
